Hi, I'm Jungsun!

I am a PhD candidate in the Department of Cognitive Sciences at the University of California, Irvine. I am advised by [Aaron Bornstein](https://aaron.bornstein.org/) in the [Computational Cognitive Neuroscience Lab](https://uciccnl.github.io/lab/). In Fall 2025, I will be joining [Princeton Neuroscience Institute](https://pni.princeton.edu/) as a postdoctoral researcher. 

You can find my CV here.

## Research Interests
*   Reinforcement learning
*   Cognitive graphs

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
